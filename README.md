# Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)


## Project description

This is a curated list of academic papers and articles about [ME/CFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome). The key objectives here are:
- have a central and starting point for those looking for more information about this medical condition;
- receive your help and contribution by suggesting new papers or scientific articles.


## FAQ

1. I have something to suggest and it's a scientific/academic document. What should I do? \
Click [here](https://github.com/fmachado/me-cfs/issues/new/choose) and select _"Request: scientific article / academic paper"_. Follow the instructions shown there.


2. I have a homemade solution, recipe or something that worked for me or someone that I know. May I sugest it here? \
No.
